# Project Status

Currently with the 3rd party api from trefle.io removing their rest api this project is dead in the water. I am currently working on making a new api that will follow a plant identification guide I used back in college while earning my B.S. degree. This project will stay on my github for inspiration and to check back to see how much I have grown as a developer.
